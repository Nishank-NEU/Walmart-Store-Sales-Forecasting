# Walmart-Store-Sales-Forecasting
Overview : 
This project focuses on forecasting Walmart store sales using machine learning techniques. The forecasting models were developed using Python and various machine learning packages. The coding and analysis were conducted using Google Colab. The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle.

Methodology : 

1. Data Cleaning and Feature Selection: The initial step involved data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature selection using machine learning techniques in Python. This phase aimed to prepare the dataset for model training.

2. AutoML Library Usage: An AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) library was employed to automate the process of model selection, training, and optimization. This approach helps in efficiently exploring various machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters to find the best model for sales forecasting.

3. Model Interpretability: Model interpretability techniques were applied to understand the factors influencing sales predictions. This phase involved analyzing feature importance, partial dependence plots, and other interpretability methods to gain insights into the model's decision-making process.

4. ML Report Creation: Finally, all the findings and insights from the forecasting models were combined to create a comprehensive machine learning report. This report aims to summarize the analysis, model performance, and key insights derived from the Walmart store sales forecasting project.
